## 1. Installing dependencies
```
cd todo-worker
npm install
```
## 4. Boot up the application.
```javascript
node worker.js
```

*Note*

The app will start a server listening on port 3002, having a single action: **process.todo**

This is a small example application on how the discovery system works and how communication between different nodes work

The actual implementation on todo processing is not done and should be done using your own ideas :)
